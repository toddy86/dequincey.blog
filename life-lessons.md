### <a id='about'>What is this book about?</a>
As I slowly navigate my way through life I have often come to reflect on the lessons which life has taught me along the way. Unfortunately, many of these lessons were already explained to a younger version of myself, but like many others I had to learn these lessons through experience before I would listen. That is a lesson unto itself - listen to the experience of others. And not listen so you can reply or rebut their point of view, but truly listen. Listen, reflect and absorb from others' experience and you will be able to live and learn the lessons of multiple lives.

So why write all of this down into a book which no one will likely ever read? The answer is simple my dear Watson - <a href="https://dequincey.blog/2018/01/01/why-I-write/">to learn through writing</a>a>. As well as to not forget, as a lesson learnt but quickly forgotten is never learnt at all. 

Finally, like life itself, this is a story which ends when I do. Meaning, it is an ongoing manifesto of the wisdom learnt, and perhaps unlearnt, along the way.

<b>Technology Review</b>

Jekyll is a great tool for creating a static website, which helps eliminate some of the repetition which can arise with maintaining a static site (e.g. having to manually update the headers on each pages).

Jekyll isn't the most beginner friendly platform, but after 1-2 days of experimentation, even a beginner can become well versed in the platform.

As Jekyll sites can be hosted on GitHub pages for free, it is a very cheap way for professionals, companies or bloggers to get started.


<h3>How to create a Jekyll website</h3>
There isn't much point me reproducing the steps required to create a site with Jekyll, as the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll documentation</a> is very well written.

The Jekyll code for this site can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/toddy86/dequincey.blog">GitHub account</a>.
