  <h1 class="page-heading">Projects</h1>

  <p>The projects listed here were created either because of an actual problem that I needed to solve (e.g. web scraping) or because I wanted to learn more about a programming or data science technique or technology stack.</p>

  <p>Each project I attempt to use new libraries, tools or technologies to progress my knowledge and skill set.</p>

  <p>Each project contains a summary of what I wanted to achieve, the things I learnt along the way and step-by-step instructions so that I or someone else can reproduce the project in the future.</p>
