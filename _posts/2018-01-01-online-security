The following are the products and services which I use to ensure I am as safe as I can be whilst online. Last updated 10 June 2017.

If you have a product or service you use and others should know about it, share the love and email me on todd.dequincey@gmail.com

LastPass.com


If you are like the vast majority of people, you probably have the same password for every single application and it is likely something easy to remember like Bunnies123. Bad, bad, bad. Each password for each website you use should be different and should be a strong password that cannot be easily cracked (e.g. not using a common word or phrase). But who can remember the password hf&T5jKd:!@k24 – certainly not me.

That is where a password manager, like Lastpass.com come in. All you need to do is install the app, make sure the app itself has a very strong and unique password. The the app will remember all of your new and hard to crack passwords.

Available in the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, Chrome Web Store or on the web.

I also recommend setting up a Google Alert for LastPass, so if for any reason they are ever hacked, you will be one of the first to know when you see the news article in your inbox. Call me cautious.

Windscribe.com
If you ever surf the web using public wifi you must use a VPN. There are a million and one articles online which explain why you should use a VPN, so I will let you google the reasons. But if you want a reliable and affordable (I use their free tier) VPN, then you cannot go past Windscibe.com. They have applications for all major platforms (Apple, Windows etc) and as mentioned, their free VPN tier is enough for most peoples needs.

Google Authenticator


Two-factor authentication is a staple of modern day security. If you don’t know what it is, in short when you login to an application (e.g. your email) the application will ask you to enter a time sensitive code which is sent to you via SMS or more commonly via an authentication application. Meaning that if someone somehow gets a hold of your password they still can’t access your account unless they have your phone as well. Pretty handy.

There are a number of authentication applications out there, but being a Google groupie, the Google Authenticator is my weapon of choice.

Available in both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
