The following are the products and services which I use to rapidly learn languages. Last updated 19 August 2017.

If you have a product or service you use and others should know about it, share the love and email me on todd.dequincey@gmail.com

<h3>The Michel Thomas Method</h3>

My starting point when approaching any new language for the first time. Michel Thomas promises you to learn a language with “no books, no writing, no memorising and just confidence”. Perhaps a slight overstatement, but his audio only courses will provide you with an extremely solid base of any given language.

After completing the Michel Thomas course I generally find you can construct sentences correctly, effectively communicate simple ideas, get around travelling and all whilst learn a lot of grammar – even though he does not not use a single grammatical term.

An absolute pleasure, not a pain, when learning with the Michel Thomas Method, which can lead to a slight skill vs confidence gap, but an amazing course to start with nonetheless.

The course comes in 12 different languages (I have used for French and Spanish). It’s not cheap,  but worth every penny.

<h3>iTalki</h3>

If you want to speak and understand a language, there are no shortcuts. You must speak (and make lots of errors) as often as possible with natives. We become what we practice, so conversation practice is an unavoidable must in language learning.

iTalki is a platform which allows you to contact natives and have conversations online. There are free options (finding a language exchange partner), community tutors (great for general conversation practice) and professional teachers (qualified teachers) available.

iTalki has been absolutely invaluable to my language learning and I have met some amazing people from it as well.

Use my link below to sign up and we both get a free $10 voucher.

<h3>Assimil Method</h3>


The Assimil Method uses a combination of audio and written material, with each lesson small enough to fit into even the busiest of daily schedules. This is the latest tool in my language learning arsenal and I find each lesson teaches you useful vocabulary and real world expressions, whilst also working your comprehension skills.

The copy which I have is quite old and has some outdated material, but if you need a structured approach to progressively learning more with your language then I highly recommend Assimil.

Not sure how many languages Assimil comes in, but there is a lot.

<h3>Anki</h3>
If you don’t use it, you lose it, which is particularly true for language learning. To commit new vocabulary, expressions, phrases or sentences to memory the best and easiest way I have found is to use a spaced repetition flashcard system. This is what Anki provides. Either create your own personalised deck of flashcards as you learn new vocabulary (my preference) or import one of the many free vocabulary decks from the website. Absolutely invaluable for language learning or learning anything at all!

Available in the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store or on the web.

<h3>Forvo</h3>


Never quite sure on how to pronounce a new word that you see? Me too! Thankfully the team at Forvo.com help make our language learning journey a little easier with them app. Search for a word or phrase and then listen to native speakers from around the world correctly pronounce the word. If the word or phrase isn’t already in their database you can make a request to have a native pronounce it for you.

Available in the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store or on the web.

<h3>Wordreference.com</h3>
Now that you know how to pronounce the word, what the hell does it mean! Wordreference.com is an online dictionary for language learning like no other. Better than any physical dictionary in my opinion, with great examples and all of the possible meanings listed alongside one another so you can pick the definition which best fits the context.
