A revealation that I had whilst reading Life is Long enough... by Seneca for the third time 10/01/2020

- Stoics say that we need to "live" each day to its fullest. But what is living life to its fullest / living a proper life?
- It is taking joy in all of the small (and big) things in life. Being amazed by the wonder of life. Taking interest, amazement and orr of everything life has to offer. That is truly living life. 
- Living life is not worrying about the future. Worrying about how much money you have in the bank. Worrying about what others think about you. 
- Living is ensuring that every moment of life is spent living how you want to live. Not spending your time on what others want of you. Guarding your time for you.
- Stoics believe that if you reflect on the past and are haunted by it, that you have mislived. If you look at the past and see that you have ferretted away your time on work, other people, public opinion etc, or have been sour, or have lived only with the future in mind (e.g. retirement), then you have mislived. And this is the very reason why the "pre-occupied mind" does not often reflect on the past. As it is shamefull and not full of joy. 
- However, if you spend each day living a true, proper, full life, then you can spend your time wandering through the memories of the past with warmth and happiness in your heart. In fact, you should do this (reflect on the past) often, as that is a way to check if you are living a good life. It also "extends" your life, as you can wander through all of the small marvals that you enjoyed in the past at any time, with the future never being able to take that away from you. The past is done, and the future cannot take away the fond memories from you if you have truly lived.
- Further more, if you have truly lived each day, without fear for the future, when Death does inevitably knock on your door, you can embrace him, instead of run from him. As you know and you can remember that every day you lived, you lived it to its fullest. You embraced all life had to offer. You laughed. You loved. You found the joy in every little thing possible.
