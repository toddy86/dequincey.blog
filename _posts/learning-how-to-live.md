### Living Life to its Fullest

Anyone who has encounted stoicism understands that the main goal of a stoic is to avoid misliving life. Put another way, living life to its fullest. But what does this actually mean? This meaning escaped me for many years, until it finally clicked during my third reading of Seneca's "On the Shortness of Life". 


Whilst others can (and will) disagree, living life to its fullest is comprised of three interlocking concepts. Firstly, it is the attainment, no the regular pracitce, of stoic joy. Secondly, it is guarding your finite resource of time for what truly matters. And finally, its is learning how to correctly manipulate time, the past, present and the future, to make even the shortest of lives, long.

**Stoic Joy**
Stoic joy is simply the glowing, soul warming feeling that you can achieve by taking wonder in all that life has to offer, big or small. Many mispend their lives chasing adventure. Chasing the next thrill, excitment or distraction to trick themselves into believing that they are living life to its fullest. Just search the internet and you will find countless sites dedicated to others showing off how they are "living life to its fullest" through their neverending travels, attainment of wealth or public display other socially accepted definitions of success and happiness. 

But the trap that these people have fallen into is that this feeling of joy is merely tempoary. Their method of attaining joy is fundamentally flawed. Each time that they attain joy through these grand, public displays, the joy quickly washes away like a sand castle being battered by the income tide. And like any addict, the next hit must come from even grader, larger plans to get the same feeling of wonder, excitement and joy. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with travelling and enjoying everything life has to offer. But using travel, possesions, wealth and other meaningless yardsticks as the measuring stick of how well you are living life is a game for fools. 

Joy, should be obtainable from even the simplest of things. By taking orr in how the light reflects off a glass in the afternoon sun. By truly appreciating the satisfying feeling of a cold glass of water on a hot summers day. By being uplifted and energised by the fresh, crisp air on a cold winters morning. Many may think that this will make you a simpleton, but the reality couldn't be further from this. If you are truly amazed by all that life has to offer, be it grand travels or a simple glass of water, then every day of your life will be your best. 

By taking wonder in all that life has to offer, your soul will glow. You mind will be at peace. And you will truly enjoy every moment life has to offer.

**Guarding Time**


- Living life is not worrying about the future. Worrying about how much money you have in the bank. Worrying about what others think about you. 
- Living is ensuring that every moment of life is spent living how you want to live. Not spending your time on what others want of you. Guarding your time for you.


**Manipulating Time to Live a Long Life**
It is often said that depression comes from living in the past, anixiety from living in the future and contentment from living in the present. I generally do not argue with these definitions, but having such a narrow view of time restricts you to living life only in the ever fleeting present. Whilst occupying the mind with the future serves no purpose, as the future is never guaranteed, wandering through the past can provide endless pleasure, presuming you have lived life to its fullest.

If you reflect on the past and are haunted by it, then it is likely you have mislived life. If you look on the past and see that you have ferretted away your time on the attainment of weath, physical possessions or public opinion, or have lived a life in a constant state of jelousy or sourness, or have lived only with the future in mind, then you have mislived. This is how, unfortunately, most people live their lives. And it is this very reason why the pre-occupied mind does not often reflect on the past. Their past is shamefull, chasing meaningless goals.

But, if you spend each day living a true, proper life, filled with stoic joy, then you can invest some of the present wandering through the memories of the past with warmth and happiness, knowing that you have not mislived your life. In fact, you should reflect on the past often. Use it as a test to see if you are living a good life. By properly living life, with a flow of joyous memories, we can extend our lives. You can wander through all of the small marvals from your past at any time, with the future never being able to take that away from you. The past is done, the future is not guaranteed and the present is now. 

In you have not mislived, at your dying moment, when Death has come to take you away, you can live all over again by walking through memory lane and bath in the countless moments of joy which you chose to embrace throughout your life. You will not fear death. You will be at peace knowing that you lived life to its fullest. You laughed. You loved. You found the joy in the simplest of things and every moment possible. You lived.


**OLD NOTES**

- A revealation that I had whilst reading Life is Long enough... by Seneca for the third time 10/01/2020
- Stoics say that we need to "live" each day to its fullest. But what is living life to its fullest / living a proper life?
- It is taking joy in all of the small (and big) things in life. Being amazed by the wonder of life. Taking interest, amazement and orr of everything life has to offer. That is truly living life. 
- Stoics believe that if you reflect on the past and are haunted by it, that you have mislived. If you look at the past and see that you have ferretted away your time on work, other people, public opinion etc, or have been sour, or have lived only with the future in mind (e.g. retirement), then you have mislived. And this is the very reason why the "pre-occupied mind" does not often reflect on the past. As it is shamefull and not full of joy. 
- However, if you spend each day living a true, proper, full life, then you can spend your time wandering through the memories of the past with warmth and happiness in your heart. In fact, you should do this (reflect on the past) often, as that is a way to check if you are living a good life. It also "extends" your life, as you can wander through all of the small marvals that you enjoyed in the past at any time, with the future never being able to take that away from you. The past is done, and the future
