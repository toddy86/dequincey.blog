## General Notes
### Big Query vs On-Premise Solutions 
- On GCP, storage and compute are decoupled 
- Whereas on-premise, they both reside on the same server
- Separate pricing for storage and compute, which should save costs
- Fully managed and automatic scaling on BigQuery

### BigQuery Fundamentals
- MUST have a project, which organises all of your activities
- Use the comment of #standardSQL at the top of queries (if being shared) to ensure the other user is using the standard SQL. 
- Can set queries to be private, project visible or public
- Queries are cached, so if they are run again we aren't charged again
- Use the preview option instead of running a limited query to save costs

### 9 Key Features of BigQuery
1. Fully-managed data warehouse - no-ops, petabyte-scale
2. Reliability
3. Economical - pay only for what you use
4. Security - encrypted in transit and at rest
5. Auditable - every transaltion is logged
6. Scalable - highly paralell processing model 
7. Flexible - Mashup data across multiple datasets

### 3 Ways to Interface with BigQuery
1. Web UI
2. CLI
3. REST API


### Pricing
You only incur query job processing costs. Job types include:

1. Query - charged by bytes processed
2. Load data - free
3. Extract - free
4. Copy - free

Storage of data in Big Query is a separate cost.

#### 3 Categories of BigQuery Pricing

1. Storage - automatic discounts for old data (tables with data untouched for a month have the storage cost reduced by 50%)
2. Processing - on demand or flat rate plans. On demand is based on amount of data processed. 1TB/month free. Have to opt in to run high-compute queries
3. Free - loading, exporting, queries on metadata, cached queries, queries with errors

#### Reserved Slots
- Slots are amount of total query throughput
- Reserving slots is a contractual engagement with Google whereby you have certain resources dedicated to you at predefined times (e.g every Friday at 7pm)
- Useful if you have very high work loads at known intervals
- Helps minimise variability in query performance
- By default you are on the shared resource pool

### Quotas
- 50 concurrent queries
- Query timeout: 6 hours
- 1,000 updates to a Table per day
- 1,000 tables referenced by a single query
- Max result size 128MB Compressed

### Optimise Queries for Cost
- Only include the columns and rows needed
    - Do not use SELECT *
    - Filter rows early
- Use cached results when possible
    - Use permanent tables instead of views
    - Views are saved queries
- Limit the use of User-Defined Functions

### Misc Notes
- Standard SQL is ANSI 2011 compliant and has performance advantages
- Can run sections of code by highlighting the code and running
- Hold down command and click on the table name to insert it into your query
- Use the preview option to take a peek at the data in your table without running a query. Running a query will cost you money, previewing won't
0 "size_bytes" is a reserved key word in BigQuery

### Data Types
- INT64 - 64 bit, can be nagative
- FLOAT64 - 64 bit
- STRING
- DATE - yyyy-mm-dd
- BOOL
- ARRAY - ['apple', 'pear']
- STRUCT - <apple string>


### Data Integrity
#### 5 Principles of Dataset Integrity
1. Validity 
    - Challenges: out of range, empty fields, data mismatch
2. Accuracy 
    - Challenges: lookup datasets, do not exist
3. Completeness 
    - Challenges: missing data
4. Consistency 
    - Challenges: duplicate records, concurrency issues
5. Uniformity 
    - Challenges: Same unit of measurement

### Common Commands & Syntax Notes
#### Must Escape the full name of the table as \`project.dataset.table`
```
#standardQL
SELECT column1
FROM `project.dataset.table`
```

#### Format Function
For example, add commas to numeric results to make it easier to read.

Caution, format converts the data to a string. So you can unintentionally change the data type!
```
SELECT FORMAT("%,d", revenue_column) AS rev
FROM `my_project.dataset_name.revenue_table`
```
#### Aggregation Functions
- SUM()
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- MIN()
- MAX()

#### Dates

```
-- Extract Dates
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column)

-- Current Date
CURRENT_DATE([time_zone])

-- Add interval of time
DATE_ADD(DATE "2019-01-01", INTERVAL 10 DAY)

-- Subtract interval of time
DATE_SUB(DATE "2019-01-01", INTERVAL 10 DAY)

-- Difference between two dates
DATE_DIFF(DATE "2019-01-01", DATE "2018-01-01", DAY)

-- Truncate the date to the earliest start period
DATE_TRUNC(DATE "2019-01-31", MONTH) -- Returns "2019-01-01"

-- Parse a string to proper date format
PARSE_DATETIME("12/07/2019")
```


#### Strings
Cast a string
```
CAST('1234' AS INT64)
```

If not sure what the data should be coming in as, instead of erroring out, can use safe cast instead which will convert the erronous value to NULL instead.
```
-- Will return NULL instead of erroring out
SELECT
    SAFE_CAST("apple" AS INT64)
```

Concatenate strings
```
CONCAT("abc", "efg") -- Returns abcdefg
```

Check if a string ends in a value
```
ENDS_WITH("Apple", e) -- Returns True
```

Lower / upper case 
```
LOWER("Apple") -- Returns "apple"
UPPER("apple") -- Returns "Apple"
```

Regex
```
REGEXP_CONTAINS("Lunchbox", r"^*box$") -- Returns True
```

#### Wildcard Searches
To search for an argument with only a single character before or after, use the underscore
```
"This" LIKE "_his" -- returns True
"TTTTThis" LIKE "_his" -- returns False
```

Unlimited number of characters before or after the search
```
"This" LIKE "%his" -- returns True
"TTTTThis" LIKE "%his" -- returns True
```

#### Data Cleaning with SQL
Cleaning for Validity
```
CASE WHEN
IF()
-- Also specifying fields as nullable or required
```

Cleaning for Accuracy
```
IN() -- with a subquery or JOIN
```

Cleaning for Completeness
```
NULLIF()
IFNULL()
COALESCE()
```

Cleaning for Consistency
```
PARSE_DATE()
SUBSTR()
REPLACE()
```

Cleaning for Uniformity
```
FORMAT()
CAST()
```
