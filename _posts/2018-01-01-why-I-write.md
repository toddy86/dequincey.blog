title: Why I write
categories: thoughts

Someone recently asked me, why I write my newsletter and on this blog. Do I write for hope of fame, for praise or in pursuit of fortune? None of these are reason why I write.

I write to simply know and understand my own thoughts more clearly.

As I write, I am dissecting the logic and reasoning behind each specific thought or opinion. Writing helps to clear my mind of ambiguity and doubt.

As I write, I am striving for the clearest writing I can possible. For clear writing is clear thinking.

I write for me, but I hope that it will be of use to others as well.
