title: Why I write
categories: thoughts
---

Someone recently asked me, why I write my newsletter and on this blog. Do I write for hope of fame, for praise or in pursuit of fortune? None of these are reason why I write.

<!-- more -->

I write to simply know and understand my own thoughts more clearly.

As I write I am dissecting the logic and reasoning behind each specific thought or opinion. Writing helps to clear my mind of ambiguity and doubt.

As I write I am striving for the clearest writing I can possible, for clear writing is clear thinking.

I write for me, but I hope that it will be of use to others as well.

Book recommendation: The best book I have ever read on writing is ‘On writing well’ by William Zinisser. You can read my book notes here

<b>Disagree?</b>

Good. I am not proposing that the above is the be all and end all on the subject. Truth be told, I will likely change my view with time. But strong opinions lead others to defend their own. So if you disagree with this article then I have delivered value, as it helps you solidify your own point of view, challenges your status quo and hopefully helps you see you view on the matter even more clearly than before.
