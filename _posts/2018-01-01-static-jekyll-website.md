<b>Technology Review</b>

Jekyll is a great tool for creating a static website, which helps eliminate some of the repetition which can arise with maintaining a static site (e.g. having to manually update the headers on each pages).

Jekyll isn't the most beginner friendly platform, but after 1-2 days of experimentation, even a beginner can become well versed in the platform.

As Jekyll sites can be hosted on GitHub pages for free, it is a very cheap way for professionals, companies or bloggers to get started.


<h3>How to create a Jekyll website</h3>
There isn't much point me reproducing the steps required to create a site with Jekyll, as the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll documentation</a> is very well written.

The Jekyll code for this site can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/toddy86/dequincey.blog">GitHub account</a>.
