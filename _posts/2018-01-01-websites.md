The following are the products and services which I use to Power this site. Last updated 10 June 2017.

If you have a product or service you use and others should know about it, share the love and email me on todd.dequincey@gmail.com

Hover.com


The first thing you will need when creating a website is a domain. Whilst there are a mountain of domain registry options out there, my preference is hover.com. Why I use Hover.com over others? Simply due to great price, dead simple to use and each domain comes with free whois privacy – so your personal details can remain private.

Bluehost.com


Once armed with your domain name, you need hosting. Once again there are a million options to choose from, but Bluehost.com is one of the leaders out there. Not the cheapest, but they have great support, great up-time and I have never had a problem with them. If you are just creating a blog or any other non-commercial, low traffic site, just go for one of their shared hosting plans and save yourself a few bucks.

WordPress.com


Unless you are a techie, you will want a simple way to create a decent looking site. If so, WordPress.com is the solution for you. Simple to use and you can have a site up and running is just a couple of hours. The problem you will have is knowing which theme to choose and which plugins you need. All depends on your needs, but below are the plugins I use and recommend:

BackUpWordPress – free backup management for your site
Envira Gallery – an easy to use, good looking photo album plugin. Not free, but I didn’t like the stock WordPress one
Mailer Lite Signup Form – Easy to use and cheap email system. Capture peoples emails on your site and send them spam (joking).
WP Fastest Cache – without getting technical, it helps speed up your page
Make sure you don’t get too trigger happy with plugins, as they will slow down your site, and always make sure they are up to date – otherwise you put yourself at a security risk.

Mailerlite.com


If you are going to send out an email newsletter or anything of the sorts, then you will need an email marketing system. My preference is Mailerlite.com. Why? Dead simple to use, free for the first 1,000 email subscribers, lots of integrations and they allow you to create a variety of sign up forms – landing pages, embedded forms, pop ups (yuck) etc. Waaaay better than the market leader, MailChimp.
